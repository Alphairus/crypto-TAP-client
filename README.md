# Crypto-TAP  

## Planning Story
I have been involved in the world of cryptocurrency since 2017 and something that
began as a small habit has become a primary passion of mine, infact; it is what
finally drove me to change my career as a Doctor of Chiropractic to a path into
technology, specifically with an end-goal of working in blockchain technology.
 [crypto-TAP](https://github.com/Alphairus/crypto-TAP-client) comes to the scene
 ready to handle all of cryptocurrency needs!  

This app is intended to be used with our [API](https://github.com/Alphairus/crypto-TAP-api)

The app itself is relatively simple. A user signs up on the [website](https://alphairus.github.io/crypto-TAP-client/#/) and can add different coins and modify them at will. Each coin has its own properties which help users categorize and separate them. The website makes request to the [back-end](https://whispering-depths-77462.herokuapp.com/) and handles all the coins from there.
